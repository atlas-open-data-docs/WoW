# Histogram animation

An animation of the accumulation of Higgs events over time in the four-lepton channel show us that it is important to collect large data samples.  You can see the signal emerging from the background as more and more events are added.

As more data is collected (notice the date changing), the number of events analysed increases (notice the change in scale of the y-axis).  The size of the error bars on the data points decrease as the volume of data increases, allowing the signal to be seen.
