\(t\bar t Z \rightarrow \rightarrow bW^+ \bar b W^- \ell^+ \ell^- \rightarrow bq\bar q' \bar b q\bar q' \ell^+ \ell^-\)

(\(\ell\) = lepton = electron or muon)

We are looking for \(t \bar t Z\) decays into two leptons, two b-quarks and two \(W\) bosons which subsequently decay into quarks.

The major background contributions to the search in this decay mode are top quark pair, and \(Z\)+jets events.


**Use the cursor to implement the following cuts, one by one.  
As you apply the cuts, you should see the distributions changing.**

Try to understand why each of the distributions change.  Think of the physics motivating the cuts.

Now let's try to separate the signal from the background using Histogram Analyser

## \(t \bar t Z\) with 6 jets

We want to select events which contain two leptons, low missing transverse momentum and 6 jets.

Select:

* Number of Jets at least 6 : We have decided this analysis is specifically with at least 6 jets.

* Channel \(ee\) and \(\mu\mu\) : Throwing away \(e\mu\) events throws away a lot of \(t \bar t\) but not much \(t \bar t Z\).

* Reconstructed Dilepton Mass between 80 and 100 GeV : \(t \bar t\) events are a major background in this analysis.  The \(Z\) boson has a mass of 91 GeV, which is reconstructed from the mass of the two leptons.  Requiring Reconstructed Dilepton Mass to be around the \(Z\) boson mass removes a large fraction of \(t \bar t\) events.

* Number of b-tagged Jets at least 2 : \(t \bar t Z\) decays contain similar amounts of events with 1 and 2 b-tagged jets, whereas \(Z\) boson decays mostly contain 0 b-tagged jets. Therefore, requiring at least 2 b-tagged jets is a worthwile cut.

The dominant background after all these cuts in the  
\(t \bar t Z\) with 6 jets channel comes from \(t \bar t\) and \(Z\)+jets.

12 \(t \bar t Z\) events are identified, yielding a significance of 0.885

## \(t \bar t Z\) with 5 jets

Select:

* Number of Jets = 5
* at least 2 b-tagged jets
* \(ee\) and \(\mu\mu\) channels only
* Reconstructed Dilepton Mass between 80 and 100 GeV

The dominant background after all these cuts in the  
\(t \bar t Z\) + 5 jets channel comes from \(Z\)+jets and top pair  
production.

7 \(t \bar t Z\) events are identified, yielding a significance of 0.329.

## Have a go yourself!

Perhaps try the \(t \bar t Z\) with 6 jets, but separate it into leptonic channels and tune the cuts to maximise the number of \(t \bar t Z\) events with maximum significance.

Or try something completely different...
