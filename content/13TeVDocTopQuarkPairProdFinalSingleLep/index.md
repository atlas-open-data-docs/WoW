The top quark is the heaviest elementary particle in the SM, with a mass mt of around 172.5 GeV, which is close to the electroweak symmetry breaking scale. At the LHC, top quarks are primarily produced in quarkâ€“antiquark pairs (tt), and due to its large production cross section ( around 830 pb at 13 TeV), the LHC can be viewed as "a top-quark factory". Top quarks have a rich phenomenology which includes high-pT jets, b-jets, leptons and missing transverse momentum. Its understanding is crucial for studying rarer processes, given that tt production is a background to virtually all processes having leptons and multiple jets in their final states.

In order to identify these events, one needs to apply the standard object-selection criteria (defined in "Reconstructed physics objects"), with a stricter lepton pT requirement and tight lepton identification criteria, and an event-selection criteria defined as:

At the end, one is able to compare data and MC prediction for the distribution of e.g. the invariant mass of the three-jets combination with the highest vector pT, as seen below:
