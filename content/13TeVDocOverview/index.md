# **The ATLAS Open Data 13 TeV docs**

The aim of the 13 TeV ATLAS Open Data is to **provide data and tools** to high school, undergraduate and graduate students, as well as teachers and lecturers, to help educate and train them in analysis techniques used in experimental particle physics. Sharing data collected by the ATLAS experiment aims to generate excitement and enthusiasm for fundamental research, inspiring physicists of the future.

The following documentation provides **introductory material and detailed information** for a wide audience about the ATLAS experiment, the released 13 TeV ATLAS Open Datasets and their visualisation, the analysis frameworks and Jupyter notebooks, as well as the virtual machine usage instructions.
