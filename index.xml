Ranging from measuring Standard Model particles including a Higgs analysis and a search for a Beyond the Standard Model particle. Let&amp;rsquo;s take a look at these processes.
\( W \) Boson Analysis The \( W \) and \( Z \) bosons are together known as the weak or the intermediate vector bosons. These Standard Model elementary particles mediate the weak interaction.
The \( W \) boson analysis is intended to provide an example for a high statistics analysis using the ATLAS open data dataset.</description></item><item><title>8TeV Doc</title><link>https://atlas-open-data-docs.github.io/WoW/8tevdocoverview/</link><pubDate>Mon, 23 Nov 2020 04:51:13 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://atlas-open-data-docs.github.io/WoW/8tevdocoverview/</guid><description>Welcome to ATLAS at the LHC.
We have prepared some data for you. Come and take a look.
It is ready for you to use, just for curiosity, as a teaching tool or to dive in and write your own analysis code.
This section is aimed at University students and post graduate researchers. Software skills may help, but are not essential. A good amount of motivation is the main requirement to follow the various steps.</description></item><item><title>A Week At Cern</title><link>https://atlas-open-data-docs.github.io/WoW/blogpost/</link><pubDate>Mon, 23 Nov 2020 04:51:13 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://atlas-open-data-docs.github.io/WoW/blogpost/</guid><description>Our one week internship at CERN</description></item><item><title>App @13 TeV</title><link>https://atlas-open-data-docs.github.io/WoW/histogram-analyser-02/</link><pubDate>Mon, 23 Nov 2020 04:51:13 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://atlas-open-data-docs.github.io/WoW/histogram-analyser-02/</guid><description>Histogram Analyser only simulated data @13 TeV</description></item><item><title>App @13 TeV</title><link>https://atlas-open-data-docs.github.io/WoW/histogram-analyser-03/</link><pubDate>Mon, 23 Nov 2020 04:51:13 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://atlas-open-data-docs.github.io/WoW/histogram-analyser-03/</guid><description>Histogram Analyser simulated and real data @13 TeV</description></item><item><title>Apps</title><link>https://atlas-open-data-docs.github.io/WoW/apps/</link><pubDate>Mon, 23 Nov 2020 04:51:13 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://atlas-open-data-docs.github.io/WoW/apps/</guid><description>All Apps: Online and Electron</description></item><item><title>ATLAS events</title><link>https://atlas-open-data-docs.github.io/WoW/8tevdocevents/</link><pubDate>Mon, 23 Nov 2020 04:51:13 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://atlas-open-data-docs.github.io/WoW/8tevdocevents/</guid><description>ATLAS events Beams of protons are accelerated around the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) and are brought to collide at the centre of the ATLAS detector. The collisions produce debris in the form of new particles which fly out in all directions. Over a billion particle interactions take place in the ATLAS detector every second.
The protons within the two beams are grouped in bunches which are squeezed down in size to increase the chances of a collision.</description></item><item><title>Create a new plot</title><link>https://atlas-open-data-docs.github.io/WoW/8tevdocnewplot/</link><pubDate>Mon, 23 Nov 2020 04:51:13 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://atlas-open-data-docs.github.io/WoW/8tevdocnewplot/</guid><description>Create a new plot You can create some new plots, but you need to run over all the datasets.
If you are running the small VM, you need to transfer the complete dataset you have downloaded into your input directory.
python DownloadScript.py -a 'unzip, replace' This command unzips complete_set_of_ATLAS_open_data_samples_July_2016.zip and replaces the data samples that are currently in your input directory.

The ATLAS Open Data datasets are available on this website and on the CERN Open Data portal.
One inverse femtobarn corresponds to approximately 100 trillion proton-proton collisions.
Simulated data Simulated data, commonly named Monte Carlo (MC), are a key feature for the LHC experiments. These events are simulated using current theoretical models and are used to compare theory with real data.</description></item><item><title>Dataset details</title><link>https://atlas-open-data-docs.github.io/WoW/8tevdocdatadetails/</link><pubDate>Mon, 23 Nov 2020 04:51:13 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://atlas-open-data-docs.github.io/WoW/8tevdocdatadetails/</guid><description>Dataset Details An important aspect of the data samples is that they were prepared specifically for educational purposes. To this end, precision has been traded for simplicity of use. The introduced simplifications are:
No facilities to estimate systematic uncertainties have been included as these quickly introduce large complexities.
The b-tagging scale factor is computed for a specific working point (MV1@70% efficiency). The user, however, is free to specify the b-tagging weight used for tagging jets allowing for a potential mismatch of the definition considered in the scale factor calculation and the one being actually applied.</description></item><item><title>Detector App</title><link>https://atlas-open-data-docs.github.io/WoW/detector-app/</link><pubDate>Mon, 23 Nov 2020 04:51:13 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://atlas-open-data-docs.github.io/WoW/detector-app/</guid><description>A ROOTJS visualisation of the ATLAS detector</description></item><item><title>Event selection</title><link>https://atlas-open-data-docs.github.io/WoW/8tevdoceventsel/</link><pubDate>Mon, 23 Nov 2020 04:51:13 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://atlas-open-data-docs.github.io/WoW/8tevdoceventsel/</guid><description>Event selection The events in the dataset ntuples have been selected according to a selection criteria. The variables are defined in variable names.
The standard event based selection criteria are:
A single electron or muon trigger has fired; The primary vertex has at least 5 tracks; There is at least one good lepton with \( p_T \) &amp;gt; 25 GeV; Leptons are required to be isolated ( Both ptcone30 and etcone20 &amp;lt; 0.</description></item><item><title>Glossary</title><link>https://atlas-open-data-docs.github.io/WoW/8tevdocglossary/</link><pubDate>Mon, 23 Nov 2020 04:51:13 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://atlas-open-data-docs.github.io/WoW/8tevdocglossary/</guid><description>Glossary This is not intended to be an exhaustive glossary. You will find answers to many of your questions by using a search engine. However, here are a few ATLAS physics terms explained to start you off.
ATLAS coordinate system The coordinate system of ATLAS is a right-handed coordinate system with the x-axis pointing towards the centre of the LHC tunnel, and the z-axis along the tunnel. The y-axis is slightly tilted with respect to vertical due to the general tilt of the tunnel.</description></item><item><title>Histogram animation</title><link>https://atlas-open-data-docs.github.io/WoW/8tevdochistoanimation/</link><pubDate>Mon, 23 Nov 2020 04:51:13 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://atlas-open-data-docs.github.io/WoW/8tevdochistoanimation/</guid><description>Histogram animation An animation of the accumulation of Higgs events over time in the four-lepton channel show us that it is important to collect large data samples. You can see the signal emerging from the background as more and more events are added.
As more data is collected (notice the date changing), the number of events analysed increases (notice the change in scale of the y-axis). The size of the error bars on the data points decrease as the volume of data increases, allowing the signal to be seen.</description></item><item><title>More plots</title><link>https://atlas-open-data-docs.github.io/WoW/8tevdocmoreplots/</link><pubDate>Mon, 23 Nov 2020 04:51:13 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://atlas-open-data-docs.github.io/WoW/8tevdocmoreplots/</guid><description>More plots \( Z \) Analysis The transverse mass of the \( Z \) candidate shows a peak in the distribution in the 90-95 GeV bin. The average \( Z \) mass based on published results is 91.1876 +/- 0.0021 GeV. The real and simulated data distributions are in good agreement.
If we add up the number of events in this distribution we see we have about 500 \( Z \) candidates.</description></item><item><title>News/Blog</title><link>https://atlas-open-data-docs.github.io/WoW/news/</link><pubDate>Mon, 23 Nov 2020 04:51:13 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://atlas-open-data-docs.github.io/WoW/news/</guid><description>Updates from the ATLAS Open Data community</description></item><item><title>Plots explained</title><link>https://atlas-open-data-docs.github.io/WoW/8tevdocplots/</link><pubDate>Mon, 23 Nov 2020 04:51:13 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://atlas-open-data-docs.github.io/WoW/8tevdocplots/</guid><description>Plots explained After running the TTbarAnalysis and plotting the results you will have lots of plots in your Output directory.
Let&amp;rsquo;s take a look at a few plots.
The primary vertex position in the coordinate z (where the z axis follows the beam direction and positive z points towards Geneva) is centered around zero. This is expected since the origin of the coordinate system is the nominal interaction point.</description></item><item><title>SaaS</title><link>https://atlas-open-data-docs.github.io/WoW/saas/</link><pubDate>Mon, 23 Nov 2020 04:51:13 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://atlas-open-data-docs.github.io/WoW/saas/</guid><description>Recipes for infrastructure deployment</description></item><item><title>Set up your environment</title><link>https://atlas-open-data-docs.github.io/WoW/8tevdocsetupenv/</link><pubDate>Mon, 23 Nov 2020 04:51:13 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://atlas-open-data-docs.github.io/WoW/8tevdocsetupenv/</guid><description>Setup Your Environment Watch the video &amp;lsquo;Setup your environment&amp;rsquo; to give you an idea what you will have to do.

Change the code, do whatever you like.
You have a local copy. If for some reason it all goes horribly wrong, just delete what you have and start again.
No-one will know. No-one will care.
It is much better to work out things for yourself.
