## How to contribute?
The site is integrated to the GitLab CI/CD, so, the simplest way to edit the site is editing the content directly in the GitLab Web UI.
* The website pages use Markdown, making very easy to contribute.
 * Just like this README.**md** :)
 * It also has HTML, JavaScript and custom CSS to enhance the UX.
* The **content of the website is located in the folder called** ```content```.
* All the other folders are needed by [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) to rendering and build the site. * Please, **do not modify files outside the folder** ```content```.

#### See this example
* **A)** You can start from the [GitLab project](https://gitlab.cern.ch/atlas-outreach-data-tools/aod-website-hugo-framework/). Don't forget to log in to CERN GitLab first.

* **C)** Let's modify the **About** page, so, open the folder called ```about```

* **D)** And from there, the file ```index.md```

![step 4](pics/hugo-edit-example-04.png)


* **E)** Click the **Edit** button and you will get the web editor ready for direct edition

**Notice that** you can preview your changes, but keep in mind that GitLab only renders Markdown, other elements like HTML will be shown as plain text


* **F)** Add a meaningful commit comment. Updates to the site content will be visible after a maximum of 10 min.

* **G)** if you want to get [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) locally, please, follow the [Hugo Documentation](https://gohugo.io/categories/getting-started) (it is **VERY** well done!).
